# PrepArchive

It is a React based project which is about centralization of resources of previous year question papers, notes, tutorials. It also contains assignment verification of aliens(students) by the cosmic guardians(teachers).

It allows the guardians to upload assignments, review submissions of the aliens / peasants, and give them marks. Obviously no government works without thinking of the peasants, thus we have a roll of subsidiaries for the peasants as well.

It helps peasants to look at their grades and work harder, allows them to see if the guardians have starred their assignment or not, help them choosing category wise papers and notes, and also view all papers at once.

For the night owls, it contains a starry background, and for the early risers, it contains a sunrise inspired bluish-pink sky.
